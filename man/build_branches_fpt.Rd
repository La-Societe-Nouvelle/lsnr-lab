\description{
Compute macroeconomic values of societal footprints by NACE branches (38)
}
\details{
This function aims to compute French branch societal footprints by non-financial dimension by year.
It involves, on one hand, a macroeconomic input-output modelization of the French economy and its interactions with
the rest of the world, based on INSEE IOTs, and requires, on the other hand, direct impact data from institutional sources.
